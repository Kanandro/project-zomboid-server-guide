    <h2>Welcome to the guide!</h2>
    Welcome to my quickstart <a href="http://projectzomboid.com/">Project Zomboid</a> server guide! After finishing this guide, you should understand how to host and configure your very own Project Zomboid server for you and your friends to enjoy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This guide is made for Project Zomboid build
    <strong>v32.30</strong> on
    <strong>Windows</strong>.

  <!-- Section: What's covered? -->
  <div class="content">
    <h2>What is covered in this guide?</h2>
    This guide covers downloading, configuring, and hosting a Project Zomboid server. It also covers installing mods on your server; <a href="http://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php/topic/11557-hydrocraft-mod/">Hydrocraft</a> is used as an example.
    By the end of the guide you should be able to do the following:
    <br>
    <br>
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <td style="width:50%">

  <!-- Section: Downloading the server -->
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Downloading the server</h2>
    Downloading the server files is fairly straightforward.
    <br>
    <div style="margin: 10px 20px 0px 20px;">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>

        </tr>
      </table>
      </a>
      <div class="step">
        In your Steam library, select the dropdown labelled "Games" (or your current selected category, e.g. "Installed," "Recent," "Favorites") and click on "Tools."
        <br>
        <br>
        <img class="logo" src="images/downloading_tools.png" width="200">
        <br> Find "Project Zomboid Dedicated Server" and install it. Once it's been downloaded, launch the server and follow the prompt to create an administrator account password. Once the server is finished loading (you'll be able to tell), type
        <code class="language-ini">quit</code> and close the window. The server is now ready to be configured.

        <br> Default setting is
        <code class="language-ini">blank</code>. </li>
      <br>
    </ul>
    There are many 56 options total, so I recommend that you figure out what the rest of them do and decide whether or not they are useful to you.
    <br>
    <br> We can now move on to configuring mods.

    <h2>Configuring mods (optional)</h2>
    <strong>NOTE: This step is not required. I recommend it, but feel free to move on to port forwarding.</strong>
    <br>
    <br> Configuring mods for your Project Zomboid server is very easy. In Project Zomboid, both the players and the server must have the same mods installed in order to work. Communicate with your players to plan which mods everyone will use. I'll be using
    <a href="http://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php/topic/11557-hydrocraft-mod/">Hydrocraft</a> as an example.

        Hydrocraft, in it's authors words, is a mod based around crafting and filling in the empty world of Zomboid with more stuff," inspired by games like <a href="http://www.havenandhearth.com/portal/">Haven and Hearth</a>. It adds crafting trees for
        alchemy, herbalism, metallurgy, mining, and many other professions, and adds hundreds of other items. This mod is core to my server experience.

        <img class="logo" src="images/modding_hydrocraft.jpg" width="500">
        <br>
        <strong>Download <a href="http://pz-mods.net/weapons-items/Hydrocraft/">the non-Workshop version of Hydrocraft</a>.</strong> Extract the contents of the zip file into a folder named
        <code class="language-ini">Hydrocraft</code>. The folder will contain a
        <code class="language-ini">media</code> folder containing mod assets, a
        <code class="language-ini">Hydrocraft ReadMe.txt</code> containing credit to contributors, a
        <code class="language-ini">mod.info</code> file containing mod name, poster file specification, id, and description, and the
        <code class="language-ini">poster.png</code> image.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Move the
          <code class="language-ini">Hydrocraft</code> folder, containing all the files I just described, to
          <code class="language-ini">C:\Users\%username%\Zomboid\mods</code>.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Now, open the Hydrocraft folder and open
          <code class="language-ini">mod.info</code>.</strong> One of the lines should read
        <code class="language-ini">id=Hydrocraft</code>. This is the identifier you need to place after
        <code class="language-ini">Mods=</code> in
        <code class="language-ini">servertest.ini</code>. For future reference, be sure to separate mod names with a semicolon if you end up with more than one.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Have all players subscribe (i.e., download) <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=498441420">the Workhop version of Hydrocraft</a>.</strong> This ensures that the player client and server are on always on the same page
        referencing the same content.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Mod installation complete!</h2>
        All of the mods I have encountered so far (<a href="http://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php/topic/9245-how-to-create-a-custom-map-server/">except for maps</a>) are installed in exactly the same way. Just be sure to add the proper id to
        <code class="language-ini">servertest.ini</code> and separate them with semicolons.

  </div>

  <!-- Section: Port forwarding -->
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Port forwarding</h2>
    <strong>Port forwarding is a much better solution than Hamachi or other such products. Rather than opening ports, they create small, private virtual networks that essentially emulate LAN. They should be considered temporary solutions.</strong>
    <br>
    <br> Port forwarding is the act of telling your router to allow specific ports to receive traffic. Port forwarding is required in order for people to connect with your server. However, there are many, many,
    <em>many</em> different router models, all with different software, so I'll just give you the essentials. If you've never done this before, don't worry! So long as you are specific with the ports you open, there shouldn't be any issues.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Here's what you need to know:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Find your router on <a href="http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm">PortForward.com</a> and find out how to log in to your router.</li>
      <li>Port
        <strong>16261</strong> needs to be forwarded as
        <strong>UDP/TCP or UDP</strong>. Be sure to specify your computer as the target computer.</li>
      <li>One more port (after 16261) should be forwarded (
        <strong>as UDP/TCP or TCP</strong>) for every player slot. This can be done in a range. In my experience, I just port forward 16261-16272 as UDP/TCP.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Port forwarding complete!</h2>
    Players should now be able to connect to your public IP address, which you can find at <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">WhatIsMyIP.com</a>. Have fun!
